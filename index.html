      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        W3C Web of Things (WoT) enables applications to interact with and orchestrate connected Things at the Web scale.
        The standardized abstract interaction model exposed by the WoT Thing Description enables applications to
        scale and evolve independently of the individual Things.
        Through WoT Bindings, the abstract interactions can be bound to various network-level protocols, standards,
        and platforms for connected Things, which already have have millions of devices deployed in the field today. 
        This is done through protocol-specific URI schemes, additional descriptive vocabularies, and examples that 
        guide the implementors of WoT Things and Consumers alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines a registry of WoT bindings that make it possible to have a record of the different bindings. 
        Additionnaly, it sets the rules that govern this registry to guarantee a quality standard, long lifecycle and ease 
        of use for the developers.
