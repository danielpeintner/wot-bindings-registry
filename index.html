      <h2>Use Case</h2>
      <p>
        From the charter:
        <blockquote>
          Support WoT Interoperability: The WG will improve out-of-the-box interoperability and enable the integration of WoT into other ecosystems and communities. Thus, the WG will define core binding and profiling mechanisms, and define additional profiles and bindings, as appropriate.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Story and Use Case:
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of the W3C Web of Things is to support multiple protocols via the bindings mechanism. There are domains like smart cities and infrastructure where multiple stakeholders bring different devices and systems with different protocols. This means existing systems should be made interoperable with a descriptive approach via Thing Descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is unrealistic to incorporate a complete list of bindings into a REC document before its publication; thus, we need a more flexible mechanism.

          <p>Association of a binding with the TD specification (registry entry) SHOULD be confirmed by the WoT Working Group or its custodian.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Reasons Behind the Requirement: WoT WG is the manager of the registry.
